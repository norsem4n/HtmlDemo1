           <strong>Mobile Panini</strong> is the culmination of the dream of Antonio and Carmen
           Dolcini, who came to America looking to serve people the
           authentic recipes learned from their Sicilian family.
       </p>
       <p>
           Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he
           learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his
           technique at the Culinary Institute of Milan. His younger brother,
           Carmen, with no less of a love for cooking and good food, also
           worked in the deli and became well-acquainted with the open-air
           fresh food markets of his home town. Carmen too, is a proud graduate of the
           Culinary Institute of Milan.
       </p>
       <p>
           Now you can enjoy what they have learned and mastered, right outside
           your door; but with no compromises in freshness or delicacy of
           preparation. We've partnered with <em>Curbside Thai</em> to bring you the
           finest cuisine on four wheels - from the East and the West!
